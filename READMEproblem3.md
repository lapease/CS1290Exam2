#Problem 3 - Palindromic Substrings
1 & 2 - This problem can be solved recursively because we can use the same algorithm for different substrings of the same string. We know that the amount of substrings is at least the amount of characters in the strinjg, so we don't necessarily need to handle the base cases of each character being its own palindromic string. We could store this data in a variable called sum, then we see if the current string is a palindrome. If it is, then add 1 to sum. If not, then we use the same algorithm for the same string, but alternating between removing the first and last characters, beginning with the first. After reaching the base case of only 1 character left in the string, we return sum.

3. - I used IDEAL by identifying the problem and considering what possible solutions could work for this problem in a general sense. I then refined these ideas using Duke's 7 steps. First, I made random strings that were either palindromic or not, both with and without palindromic substrings within them. Then, I noticed that the method i was using to determine whether or not there was a palindrome involved removing the first, then last characters in the string. This was an important pattern useful for finding the solution. I then created a few more strings to test my algorithm on and it seemed to work for the cases I used. Thus I concluded that my algorithm was working for this problem.
