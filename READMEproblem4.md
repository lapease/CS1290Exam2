# Problem 4 - Arithmetic Slices

1 & 2 - This problem can be solved recursively by analyzing subsets of the original array to see if that subset is an arithmetic slice. First, we can start at the first element in the array and iterate as far as possible, stopping once the sequence is not longer arithmetic. If we reach 3 consecutive elements, then we have 1 slice, and we add 1 to a counter variable called sum. For every 1 more iteration past that initial 3, we add 1 to sum because that is another slice. Once we have gone as far as possible, then we start again from the second element in the array. This continues until we have reached the index array[array.size-2], because we can't possible have a sequence of 3 numbers from there, and return sum.

3. - I used IDEAL by identifying the problem and considering what possible solutions could work for this problem in a general sense. I then refined these ideas using Duke's 7 steps. First, I made a few random arrays containing various amounts of arithmetic slices and manually traced through and counted the number of slices. Then, I noticed that I was analyzing the arrays starting from the first element, then continuing until the constraints for the definition of arithmetic slice were broken. This was an important pattern useful for finding the solution. I then created a couple more test arrays to which i applied my algorithm and found that the sums were what i expected them to be. Thus I concluded that my algorithm was working for this problem.
